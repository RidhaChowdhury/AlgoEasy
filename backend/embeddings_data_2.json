[{"problem_id": 2, "bug_description": "This implementation fails because it doesn't remove non-alphanumeric characters before checking if the string is a palindrome. For example, the string 'A man, a plan, a canal, Panama' would not be recognized as a palindrome since spaces and punctuation are not filtered out."}, {"problem_id": 2, "bug_description": "This recursive approach does not account for case sensitivity (i.e., A is not considered equal to a), which causes the function to fail for strings that are palindromes but have mixed case letters, like 'Racecar'. The mistake here is the failure to convert the characters to lowercase when comparing them."}]
